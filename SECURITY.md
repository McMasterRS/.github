# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The McMaster Research Software Development team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [rsd@mcmaster.ca](mailto:rsd@mcmaster.ca) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.  

The RSD team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
