# About

The [McMaster University Research Software Development (RSD) team](https://u.mcmaster.ca/rsd) is a small group of professional software developers. The team directly develops software for researchers, as well as assists and supports software development by researchers.  

As part of its recent inclusion in the [Digital Research Commons Pilot](https://drcp.mcmaster.ca), the Research Software Development (RSD) team is transitioning to a revised and expanded mandate. We are presently engaging with groups across campus to identify needs and gaps related to research software development, as well as future resources, training, and solutions to be developed.
