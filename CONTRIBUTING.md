## :love_letter: Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! While we will consider all requests, we cannot guarantee your request will be accepted. If accepted, we cannot make any commitments regarding the timeline for implementation and release. However, you are welcome to submit a pull request to help!  

- **Do not open a duplicate feature request.** Search for existing feature requests first. If you find your feature (or one very similar) previously requested, comment on that issue.
- **Fully complete the provided issue template.** The feature request template asks for all necessary information for us to begin a productive conversation.
- Be precise about the proposed outcome of the feature and how it relates to existing features. Include implementation details if possible.
